# mp-bit-trees-maven

A mini-project exploring bit trees (a form of binary tree) and their use in translating between alphabets, particularly in translating to and from braille.

**Instructions for use**

There is 3 options. Get the braille representation (character encoding that mapped characters of the alphabet to six bits (0's and 1's)) or you can pick the unicode or ascii version (The physical representation of those six-bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell) of a word or sentence (if a sentence, use " ").
